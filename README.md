# HAR GAS Volatility Model(s) by Opschoor & Lucas (2023) from IJF.

This repo provides a set of functions to estimate HAR models by Opschoor & Lucas (2023) for realised volatillity under the GAS framework using ML. Model allows GAS dynamics for any of the parameters of the data generating process and thus shall be quite apealing for modelling higher moments of realised volatillity (i.e. skewness).
